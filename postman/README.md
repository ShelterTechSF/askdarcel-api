#### API Documentation

There is a new collection `Sheltertech_Data.postman_collection.json` that serves as a functional API doc for a read of set only endpoints.
This uses the `Development` and `Staging` environments.  
We can expand on this documentation to include the Change Request and Admin interfaces.

This new collection syncs with Postman's cloud hosting and reflects at https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13231981/TVYF8eMY

To get this to synchronize you must be logged into Postman locally and make edits to the file.
